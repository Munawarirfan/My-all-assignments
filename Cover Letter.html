    <h3> Dear Sir Basit</h3>
    <p> I'm writing to you regarding your company's Customer Service Representative opening. I've
        been working as a Telephone Sales Executive at Telemarketer Auto Insurance USA for more than
        2 years and have developed impeccable phone manners, and an ability to deal with agitated or
        distressed customers. I'm accustomed to working on multiple projects simultaneously,
        and I can offer new ideas to help your company grow and surpass all goals and objectives.</p>
    <p> My relevant experience includes the following highlights: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>  Making 60 cold calls a day to businesses and private individuals to solicit sales of
                goods and services </li>
            <li> Implementing a new sales strategy that reduced training
                expenses by 30% and increased the close ratio by 10% within 3 months</li>
            <li> Maintaining an average 95% customer satisfaction rating </li>
        </ul>
    <p> My experience at Telemarketer Auto Insurance USA has helped me improve my leadership skills, allowed
        me to gain organizational skills, and provided me with extensive knowledge of how to upsell services
        and goods to potential clients. I've also worked at Parade Hotel as a Front Desk Clerk, providing
        information to guests in a 150+ room hotel. Additionally, I trained and supervised 6 new staff members.</p> 
    <p>I'm looking forward to discussing my qualifications with you in more detail soon. I feel confident
        that I fulfill the requirements for your open Customer Service Representative position.
        Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>   
    <p>Sincerely</p>
